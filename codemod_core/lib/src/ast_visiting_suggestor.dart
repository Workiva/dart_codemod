/// Mixin that implements the [Suggestor] interface and makes it easier to write
/// suggestors that operate as an [AstVisitor].
///
/// With the [AstVisitor] pattern, you can override the applicable `visit`
/// methods to find what you're looking for and generate patches at specific
/// locations in the source using the offsets provided by the [AstNode]s and
/// tokens therein.
///
/// Note that this mixin provides an implementation of [generatePatches] that
/// should not need to be overridden except for performance optimization reasons
/// like avoiding analysis on certain files.
///
/// By default, this operates on the unresolved AST. Subclasses that need a
/// fully resolved AST (e.g. for static typing info) should override
/// [shouldResolveAst] to return true.
///
/// The easiest way to understand this pattern is to see an example. Consider
/// the following suggestor that aims to remove all deprecated declarations:
///
///     import 'package:analyzer/analyzer.dart';
///     import 'package:codemod/codemod.dart';
///
///     class DeprecatedRemover extends GeneralizingAstVisitor
///         with AstVisitingSuggestor {
///
///       static bool isDeprecated(AnnotatedNode node) =>
///           node.metadata.any((m) => m.name.name.toLowerCase() == 'deprecated');
///
///       @override
///       visitDeclaration(Declaration node) {
///         if (isDeprecated(node)) {
///           // Remove the node by replacing the span from its start offset to its end
///           // offset with an empty string.
///           yieldPatch('', node.offset, node.end);
///         }
///       }
///     }
