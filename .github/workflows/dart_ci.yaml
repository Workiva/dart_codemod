  # If new major versions of analyzer are released in the future and we want to
  # be compatible with multiple majors, use this workflow to validate.
  # NOTE: we're currently compatible with analyzer v5 and v6, but v5 is only
  # compatible with Dart 2 and v6 is only compatible with Dart 3, so we are
  # already testing both major versions above. Use this workflow below if we
  # need to test compatibility across multiple analyzer majors all on Dart 3.
